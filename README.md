# fashion-MNIST

CNN with tensorflow (keras) for fashion MNIST

## Dataset
I have downloaded the dataset from tensorflow. It consists of training set of 60,000 examples and test set of 10,000 examples. It consists of 28X28 greyscale images and can be classified into 10 categories.

### Note
The plotly plot doesn't show because github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.
